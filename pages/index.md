# Welcome to {{ site.title }}

This is [puppylpg](http://github.com/{{ site.github_user }})'s official website, pika~

![hello]({{ site.url }}/pics/pikachu-hello.png)

This website is where I share all my interests with you. Hope you enjoy it.

- [Tech]({{ site.url }}/tech): is where I put technology blogs when I think I have a understand about some tech;
- [Docs]({{ site.url }}/docs): life is limited and half boring only with technology. I do need more books or thoughts to enrich myself;
- [Snippet]({{ site.url }}/snippets): is a collection of small pieces whenever I wanna say something, though most of them will be about tech I think;
- [Tags]({{ site.url }}/tags): to group my articles by tags, for the purpose of convenience;
- [Recently]({{ site.url }}/recently): recent tech blogs you can see;

I like cartoons, especially:
- [Yu-Gi-Oh! 遊☆戯☆王](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/);
- [Dragon Ball](http://www.dragonballz.com/);
- [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) mainly for [Pikachu](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/pikachu);

These are all fantistic cartoons that accompany my whole childhood.

As for games:
- [Halo](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us) attracts me in recent two years;
- [CS:GO](https://blog.counter-strike.net/) is the game I have ever palyed for the longest time;
- [To the moon](https://freebirdgames.com/to_the_moon/) moves me deeply;

Interested in the other games I play? Try to find them on my [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198251761676/).

Now at my age, I restart to love to read books(not only tech books) just like when I was a chind, diving into book stores for a whole day, despite of tiredness. I perfer to pay more attention to Chinese ancient books recently, and will list them once I finish any one from now on:
- [《儒林外史》](https://www.shicimingju.com/book/rulinwaishi.html);

May we grow up together, living happily, living wonderfully, living meaningfully.

And more: sleep well.
